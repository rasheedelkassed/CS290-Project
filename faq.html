      <li>I can't find anywhere to buy tea from, am I missing something?</li><p>You are not missing anything, we don't sell tea on this website. We don't really do anything.</p>
      <li>Does this website actually provide a service of some kind?</li><p>Absolutly not, we don't even answer questions. Everything on this page is made up.</p>
      <li>If this website doesn't do anything notable, why does it exist?</li><p>Mostly because my assignment asked me to produce a website. I couldn't think of anything better since I, naturally, put it off to the last minute.</p>
      <li>Would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized ducks?</li><p>The 100 duck sized horses in a heartbeat. They seem fairly powerless.</p>
      <li>Do you actually plan on undertaking  world domination through the power of tea?</li><p>No comment.</p>
